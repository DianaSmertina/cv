### About me
Hello! I'm starting my journey in frontend development after 2 years as an analyst, because I want to move from a theoretical level to a practical one and develop services that will bring real value to people. I have always been able to quickly learn new things and work effectively in a team. Now my goal is to upgrade my hard skills and become a good specialist using my soft skills acquired in previous jobs.
